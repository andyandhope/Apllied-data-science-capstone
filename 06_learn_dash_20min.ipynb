Although it is not officially maintained or supported by the Plotly team, Dash Mantine is another powerful way of customizing app layouts. The Dash Mantine Components uses the Grid module to structure the layout. Instead of defining a row, we define a dmc.Grid, within which we insert dmc.Cols and define their width by assigning a number to the span property.\n",
